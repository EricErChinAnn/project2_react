## About the Project
Being an avid fan of the gaming and food, i often find myself searching for cooking recipe online that is inspired by fantasy with origin from film or game. However, it takes more time to search for the recipe than it takes to study it.  

This website will benefit people with similar interest as me by giving them a one stop site to meet like-minded people to post, search and review recipes that they have.

The demo of the live website can be accessed here:

## UI and UX
The aim of the this application is to create a simple and easy to use and understand layout with image and words from the site to be the main actors. Forming a theme and developing a wireframe.

## Design
### Colors
![Color choices used](img/project2_color.png)

We decided to use an array of colors that is homely and give a vibe of being in an old tavern. Themeing like so not only do they make otherwise flat and solid colors more vibrant and exciting.

As for the fonts, we want it to be more fantasy-like(Cinzel). However being a text heavy site having another font (Lustria) for ease of reading will help alot.
